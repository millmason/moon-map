# Moon map

This is a CRA! Run `yarn start` to get it going locally.

Right now, all we have is a movable moon which can be manipulated using standard orbital controls.

Ideally, the dream is to have lunar landmarks marked out on the surface of the globe.

All we actually have right now is the ability to log out WHERE someone has clicked on the globe, and an object with the long/lat coords for several landmarks on the moon. We're currently trying to place a little flag on those points. We place it, but the direction it points in is not quite what we'd like.

Potential desired interactions:
- If we have cards visible for all landmarks, clicking on a card will rotate the moon and zoom in so that we are looking at that landmark.
- If a user clicks on a landmark on the globe, the card about that landmark will be highlighted.
